One day, Cathy adventured into the computer labs in the computer science building and ran into Teddy. She inquired about Teddy's advancement in the CS program, and found out that he had not started the project yet. This was quite an unfortunate thing for Cathy to hear, and she was very sad for Teddy. 
And then out of no where a piano falls through the ceiling of the CS building. Cathy has to fight the urge to get out of her chair and play a sick piano riff. However, Teddy starts to complain about the urgency of finishing this CS project. Now Cathy is in a dilemma. She does not know what to do... Should she pursue her sudden urge of musical passion or
should she be responsible and finish the assignment.
